### 1. **Color Picker Tool**
ModernPicker offers a built-in color picker tool that enables users to select colors directly from the interface. This color picker is compatible with Chrome's built-in color selection functionality, making it easy to choose colors for design and development work.

### 2. **Multiple Color Formats**
One of ModernPicker's most powerful features is its ability to convert and display colors in a wide variety of formats:
- **HEX**: A hexadecimal color code representation.
- **RGB**: Red, Green, and Blue format for digital displays.
- **HSL**: Hue, Saturation, and Lightness format.
- **HSV**: Hue, Saturation, and Value format.
- **HSB**: Hue, Saturation, and Brightness format.
- **HWB**: Hue, Whiteness, and Blackness format.
- **CMYK**: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black for print colors.
- **CIELAB**: Perceptual color space designed to be device-independent.
- **CIEXYZ**: Another device-independent color model used in graphics.
- **NCOL**: A normalized color format.
- **VECA**: Vector color space format.
- **Decimal**: Color values in decimal representation.
- **Hex Int**: Integer representation of a hexadecimal color code.

These formats ensure that users can quickly get the right color codes, whether for web design, graphic design, or print.

### 3. **Color History**
The extension saves the user's color selection history, allowing them to revisit and reuse previously chosen colors. Each saved color includes:
- **Copy Button**: Easily copy the color code to your clipboard.
- **Delete Button**: Remove colors from the history if no longer needed.
  
This feature is especially useful when working on a project and needing to reference previously selected colors without switching back and forth between applications.

### 4. **Light and Dark Mode**
ModernPicker supports both light and dark themes to match your browser and desktop environment. Users can switch between the two modes by using the "Toggle Mode" button, which provides a comfortable viewing experience regardless of your workspace's lighting conditions.

- **Light Mode**: Optimized for brightly lit environments with a white background and dark text.
- **Dark Mode**: Best for low-light environments, offering a dark background and light text to reduce eye strain.

### 5. **Copy Notification**
When a color code is copied, a popup notification appears on the screen to confirm the successful copy. This ensures that users can confidently know that their color codes are saved to the clipboard.

### 6. **Dropdown Color Format Selection**
Users can select their preferred color format from a dropdown list rather than showing all the formats at once. This declutters the interface while allowing users to focus on their desired format quickly.

### 7. **Clear History**
The "Clear History" button allows users to remove all saved color history with a single click. This is useful for clearing old or unwanted color selections, enabling a fresh start.
